# Little_Tool_seq2seq

The Script file is a bash script which can excute in Ubuntu16.04, and it include command line which will give a little help to
enter commands in Google's seq2seq model. 
(BTW, if you can't excute the script because of "source" command line, you can use "sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash" to shut down dash and maybe this will help )
